#	My Respository for "CSCE 689: Fundamentals of Software Analysis" (Fall 2016)

This document provides an overview of my source code and software
	documentation for Programming Assignment #1 of the course
	CSCE 689, Section 601, "Special Topic: Fundamentals of Software
	Analysis," which was offered in Fall 2016.

##	Solution for Part 0

See [part 0](https://github.com/eda-ricercatore/caprese-sw-analy/tree/master/zero-assign/part-0) for the solution attempt and related software documentation.

The tasks involved:
+ "Installing" *ANTLR*.
	- Downloading the parser generator *ANTLR*.
	- Exporting the CLASSPATH for the *ANTLR* dynamic library.
	- Creating [*UNIX*] aliases for running *Java* programs/software,
		which are dynamically linked with the *ANTLR* dynamic library
		(*jar* file).
+ Try using *ANTLR* with a simple example.
	- Copy the contents of a simple grammar in Backusâ€“Naur Form (BNF)
		to a [regular/text] file, which is subsequently referred to
		as the "grammar file".
	- "Run" *ANTLR* with the "grammar file" as an input, so that a
		parser can be generated by *ANTLR*.
	- Compile the *Java*-based parser for the simple grammar, defined
		in BNF by the "grammar file".
	- Test the *Java*-based parser on some simple input.
		* View the parser output in "*LISP* notation", as a list of
			"cons"es, where each cons contains a car and cdr.
