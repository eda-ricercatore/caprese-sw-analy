This includes lexical analysis and semantic analysis.

#	Miscellaneous Information

When clarity is required, or strongly recommended, for representing
	certain information, *LaTeX* is used to typeset/represent such
	information.

Likewise, when information needs to be represented mathematically or
	symbolically with clarity, *LaTeX* notation is used to
	represent the information.

This information is not typeset in *LaTeX*, since it is typeset
	in *Markdown*.
