%	Number the slides per section. This makes it easier to track the index of the slides (or number of slides) per section, as opposed to the cumulative number of slides. When I manually track the number of slides for a presentation, each time I refactor the set of slides, I would have to update the slide numbers. I want the computer to do this automatically. Hence, I shall not do this manually.

%\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Background}
	Microarchitecture synthesis software is used to generate cycle-accurate/RTL designs of microarchitectures. \\
	\ \\
	Taint analysis has been used to determine security loopholes of software. \\

	Project Goal: Apply taint analysis to determine the security loopholes of the microarchitecture synthesis software. \\
	\ \\
	Questions: %\vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} %\itemsep -2pt
		\item Can I force a finite state machine (FSM) to enter a non-existent/invalid state?
		\item Can I force the processor to write back to memory out of order?

%	Trying to delay the not-uncommon path of engineering Ph.D.s who end up becoming "PowerPoint engineers"... Hopefully, slapping together a bunch of presentation slides to talk about any topic in any reasonable finite amount of time is not the most useful skill that I would learn as a grad student... Hey, at least I did it in LaTeX/Beamer!!!
